# FastBangs

**FastBangs** is a fast Firefox extension that adds DuckDuckGo's [bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs) functionality to Google search and greatly speeds them up by processing them before requests are made.

## Build

Before building, make sure you have the `zip` and [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) installed.

Clone this repository and run `build.sh`. The packaged extension will be placed in the `out` folder.
